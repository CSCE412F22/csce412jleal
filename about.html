              Howdy, 
<p>My name is Joey Leal, and I am from Fredericksburg, Texas. I am a junior at Texas A&M studying for a major in Computer Science and a minor in Business. I am interested in pursuing a career in tech consultancy, where I can apply knowledge from my major as well as minor. I enjoy problem solving, coding, tinkering with electronics, and working on interesting projects. A lot of interesting things can be done with computers and a lot of interesting problems can be solved as a result. I see computer science as a fascinating tool to get things. While my experiences with computer science have been greatly beneficial to me, I also wish to expand my career skill set beyond programming. I decided to minor in business to develop the professional experience and knowledge needed to qualify for tech consultancy positions. I first learned about this industry as a freshman when I attended the Deloitte Industry Night at A&M. I was immediately drawn to the dynamic nature of consulting and the fact that every project requires new skills, knowledge and in some cases being adaptable enough to relocate to client sites . Most importantly, I wish to pursue this field because of the culture of continued learning.</p>

<p>Some of the projects that I have worked on include, a motorized longboard, a hybrid fuel rocket, and a portable aquaponics system. I try to have at least one project to work on at any given time. In the span of 2017-2020, I have worked on four significant projects. In three of these projects, I worked with talented teams of diverse backgrounds in engineering, each member focusing their specific skill set on developing the project. This was one of my favorite aspects of these projects--the ability to work with a diverse group of people where each one of us brings something fundamental toward finding a solution. As much as I enjoy working with others my personal project has provided me with important experience as well. It gave me the ability to recognize my own interests and be able to specialize my skills independently. I was on my own deadline, which gave me an environment to push my own creativity.</p>

<p>In addition to my interest in consulting, I am passionate about environmental issues as well. As a freshman in college, I joined Engineers for Sustainable World (ESW), which is a project based educational outreach program that is geared towards providing sustainable solutions to our community by solving waste issues and educating Aggies on sustainability. I am proud to be a part of this program as I believe that it aligns with my values.</p>
